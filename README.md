## Overview

- Play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer

### Screenshot

![You can find the screenshots of the project on the screenshot folder](/design/screenshots/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS styling (Flexbox, Pseudo-elements, etc.)
- JavaScript
- Responsive Web Design

### What I learned

CSS:
-Learned new values that can have some properties(calc, scale);

-Overflow manipulations;

-New cool values of animations that you can manipulate;
-Utilizing pointerEvents property;


JS:
-Learned the set Timeout function;

-learned the innerWidth property that allows you to manipulate it with js when you want js to change when you have screen size width less than x;

-Utilizng math floor, math random to generate random indexes of an array;

-Maximing the image source telling js to change circumstances based on what kind of image it is(rock,paper,scissors, borders);


### Continued development

Obviously there are better ways to execute this project, however once u understand the pattern basically everything is possible to execute. However, by searching for new ways you can use those new methods to make the project progress faster, which is very reasonable.
